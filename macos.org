*NOTE* that is just my settings. Such as that I mostly switch the ~ctrl~ and ~alt~ on my system to avoid [[http://xahlee.info/emacs/emacs/emacs_pinky.html][Emacs Pinky]].

* Input bindings
** Change modifier keys for magic keyboard on Mac
Goes to ~Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcut > Modifier Keys~.

** Change modifier keys for US ANSI keyboard
I changed only ~ctrl~ and ~option~ (which maps to alt) on windows.

** Adjusting mouse/trackpad scrolling
On Mac by default the scrolling direction is the *reverse* direction you would experienced in other systems, they called it *nature scrolling*. Depends on your likeness, I disable this.

** Correcting the alt-tab behavior
In the *mission control* settings, there is an option "*When switching to an application, switch to a Space with open windows for the application*". It cause undesired behavior when you ~alt-tab~. Uncheck this.
* Application specifics

** Adjusting keybinding for iterm2
On iterm2. I have 3 major keybinding I need:
- ~alt+f~ :: moving forward a word (through sending Esc+f).
- ~alt+b~ :: moving back a word (through sending Esc+b).
- ~alt+backspace~ :: delete back a word (through sending 0x1b 0x08).
  
You can adjust this by going to ~Settings > Profiles > keys > Key mapping~. The easiest way is using *nature text editing* preset and adjust it. I also exported my config [[file:assets/nature-text-edit.itermkeymap][here]].

** Adjusting Application shortcuts
By default Emacs using ~command+Key~ for some common commands. You can adjust those, sometimes it is better to adjust those per app. Such as browser configurations.

* Some tricks on Mac
- open a folder using Finder on iTerm with ~open $(pwd)~
- Enable the settings in ~Finder > Preference > Sidebar > Show Home Folder~.
- ~cmd+shift+3~ to capture the fullscreen.
- ~cmd+shift+4~ to capture a portion of screen
